When buying a property in Canada, an offer must be made in writing so that all aspects of the transaction are clearly outlined within the offer. Once you (the buyer) have signed the document, it becomes legally binding. If you withdraw from the offer at this stage, you may lose your deposit and may also be sued. Make sure that every item staying in the property, eg. carpets, fixtures and appliances, is written on the offer as 'chattels included'. Your realtor should also insert two clauses stating that the offer will only proceed subject to building inspection and that you as the buyer are able to meet your financial obligations. Once your offer is complete it will be presented to the seller and negotiations are made. This may include changes in price, completion date and chattels. The changes are initialled by the seller and returned to you (the buyer) for your initials. The resulting Agreement of Purchase and Sale will state the purchase price and the deposit. The deposit is placed in a trust account and is credited towards the purchase price once the offer has been accepted by both the seller and the buyer and the transaction is complete.</p>\r\n              </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div class=\"card\">\r\n            <div class=\"card-header\" role=\"tab\" id=\"headingTwo\">\r\n              <h5 class=\"mb-0\">\r\n                <a class=\"collapsed\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#collapseSeven\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapseTwo\">\r\n                  <h5>7 - What about selling my property that I own in Canada?</h5></a>\r\n              </h5>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div id=\"collapseSeven\" class=\"collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"headingSeven\">\r\n              <div class=\"card-block\">\r\n                <p>When a non-resident sells Canadian real estate, he/she is required to pay the appropriate amount of taxes on any capital gain. The normal Canadian tax rates will be applied to 50% of the gain. However, a non-resident is required to pay an estimate of the tax before the sale, an amount equal to 25% of the gain. This amount is to be retained by the seller's lawyer until such time as a clearance certificate is received from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) in connection with the sale of the property. Upon payment, the CRA will issue a clearance certificate to the seller, but not until there has been a contract of purchase and sale with all subjects (conditions) removed. The wait for the certificate is usually 6-8 weeks. The non-resident seller should file a Canadian income tax return for the year in which the sale occurs and should expect to receive a refund of a portion of the taxes paid.<br><br>\r\n\r\n                Many countries, such as the U.S., have tax treaties with Canada that prevent you from being taxed in both Canada and your home country.

Here are some tips to help make your crossing quick and easy:<br><br>\r\n      <b class=\"b\">Identification</b><br>\r\n      US Citizens and legal residents of the United States do not need passports or visas to enter Canada as visitors. You should however carry some identification such as birth, voter's or naturalization certificate which shows your citizenship.<br><br>\r\n      <b class=\"b\">Children</b><br>\r\n      Canada Customs and Immigration officers are members of Child Find International. Anyone travelling with children not their own may be required to show written permission from the child's parent(s) and proper identification (birth certificate).<br><br>\r\n      <b class=\"b\">Other Countries</b><br>\r\n      Visitors from countries other than the US require a valid passport and in some cases a visitor's visa. Visas are issued by Canadian Immigration offices, embassies and consulates.<br><br>\r\n      <b class=\"b\" >Making Declarations</b><br>\r\n      Canadian Customs officials will ask your place of residence (country and city) the purpose of your visit to Canada, how long you intend to stay, and if you have anything to declare. You may be asked specifically if you are bringing alcohol, tobacco, fruit, vegetables, animals or items made from animal by-products, firearms or personal protection devices into Canada.<br><br>\r\n      Gifts up to $60 (Canadian funds) each in value are duty free provided they do not contain alcohol, tobacco or advertising material.<br><br>\r\n      As long as you meet the age requirement set by the province where you enter Canada (19 in Ontario), you may import 1.5 litres of wine or 1.14 litres (40 ounces) of liquor OR 24 x 355 ml cans or bottles of beer or ale. Those over 18 years of age may bring 200 cigarettes, 50 cigars, 200 grams of manufactured tobacco and 200 tobacco sticks.<br><br>\r\n      <b class=\"b\">Pets</b><br>\r\n      Dogs and cats accompanying their owners from the U.S. must have current (within 36 months) rabies vaccination certificates. Owners from other countries who wish to bring their pets should contact the nearest Canadian consulate or embassy.<br><br>\r\n      <b class=\"b\">Boaters</b><br>\r\n      Pleasure craft may enter Canada by trailer or under their own power and stay for a period of up to 12 months. The required Entry Permit is obtainable from Customs at port-of-entry. All boats powered by motors 10 HP or over must be licensed and the license number clearly indicated on the bow of the vessel. Boat licenses from outside Ontario are acceptable.<br><br>\r\n      <b class=\"b\">Criminal Records</b><br>\r\n      Individuals with criminal records wishing to enter Canada can apply for a waiver. This should be done 3 - 4 weeks in advance of the intended visit. It should be noted that Driving Under the Influence convictions are considered a criminal offense in Canada. Individuals with criminal records without waivers can be refused entry. Contact the nearest port of entry Canada Immigration office for more information.<br><br>\r\n      <b class=\"b\">Your Dollar Goes Farther</b><br>\r\n      US dollars and several foreign currencies enjoy a premium rate of exchange in Canada.<br><br>\r\n      <b class=\"b\">Goods and Services Tax (GST)</b><br>\r\n      As a visitor to Canada you can claim a refund of 7% on every dollar spent while in the country on accommodation and most goods you take home.<br><br></p>\r\n              </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n          \r\n          <div class=\"card\">\r\n            <div class=\"card-header\" role=\"tab\" id=\"headingTwo\">\r\n              <h5 class=\"mb-0\">\r\n                <a class=\"collapsed\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#collapseTwentytwo\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapseTwentytwo\">\r\n                  <h5>10 - I have heard of something called a “CANPASS”, what is it?</h5>\r\n                </a>\r\n              </h5>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div id=\"collapseTwentytwo\" class=\"collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"headingTwentytwo\">\r\n              <div class=\"card-block\">\r\n                <p class=\"can\">If you frequently enter Canada from the U.S., you may qualify for one or more of our CANPASS programs designed to facilitate reporting to customs for pre-approved travellers.

Personal information does not include \"aggregate\" information, which is data we collect about the use of the Site or about a group or category of products, services or users, from which individual identities or other personal information has been removed. In other words, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service.

We may collect certain information you voluntarily provide to us which may contain personal information. For example, we may collect personal information, such as your name, address, email, phone number, and other contact, property and demographic information when you register for the site, request a broker referral, request that a broker contact regarding a particular property, list a property or send us an email or contact us by other means for any reason. We may also collect contact information and credit card or other payment account information if you pay subscription or advertising fees or purchase any such products or services through the Site. In addition, personal information may be collected if you provide such information in connection with posting any property information or advertising, content or comments on the Site or participating in any interactive forums or features that may appear on the site, and we may also collect and analyze search and transaction activity information. From time to time we may collect demographic, contact or other personal information you provide in connection with your participation in surveys, contests, promotional offers, and other activities on the Site.\r\n            When you visit our web site, some information is also automatically collected, such as your computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address, your computer's operating system, the browser type, the address of a referring web site, and your activity on the Site. We treat this information as personal information if we combine it with or link it to any of the identifying information mentioned above. Otherwise, it is used in the aggregate only. We may also automatically collect certain information through the use of \"cookies.\" Cookies are small data files that are stored on a user's hard drive at the request of a Web site to enable the site to recognize users who have previously visited them and retain certain information such as customer preferences and history.

We may also share personal information with third party vendors, consultants and other service providers (\"Service Providers\") who are engaged by or working with us in connection with the operation of the Site and the Services and who need access to such information to carry out their work for us, such as payment processors and hosting services.

We may also share personal information in any manner with any company that owns, is owned by or which is under common ownership with us (collectively \"Affiliates\"), who may use such information in the same way that we do (as described above). Note that nothing in this Policy restricts the sharing of aggregate information, which may be shared with third parties without your consent.\r\n            You understand that if you post an advertisement to the Site or use any interactive areas of the Site, certain information you post on the Site will be publicly available and will be shared with other users of the Site.
