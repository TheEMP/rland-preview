When buying a property in Canada, an offer must be made in writing so that all aspects of the transaction are clearly outlined within the offer. Once you (the buyer) have signed the document, it becomes legally binding. If you withdraw from the offer at this stage, you may lose your deposit and may also be sued. Make sure that every item staying in the property, eg. carpets, fixtures and appliances, is written on the offer as 'chattels included'. Your realtor should also insert two clauses stating that the offer will only proceed subject to building inspection and that you as the buyer are able to meet your financial obligations. Once your offer is complete it will be presented to the seller and negotiations are made. This may include changes in price, completion date and chattels. The changes are initialled by the seller and returned to you (the buyer) for your initials. The resulting Agreement of Purchase and Sale will state the purchase price and the deposit. The deposit is placed in a trust account and is credited towards the purchase price once the offer has been accepted by both the seller and the buyer and the transaction is complete.</p>\r\n              </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div class=\"card\">\r\n            <div class=\"card-header\" role=\"tab\" id=\"headingTwo\">\r\n              <h5 class=\"mb-0\">\r\n                <a class=\"collapsed\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#collapseSeven\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapseTwo\">\r\n                  <h5>7 - What about selling my property that I own in Canada?</h5></a>\r\n              </h5>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div id=\"collapseSeven\" class=\"collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"headingSeven\">\r\n              <div class=\"card-block\">\r\n                <p>When a non-resident sells Canadian real estate, he/she is required to pay the appropriate amount of taxes on any capital gain. The normal Canadian tax rates will be applied to 50% of the gain. However, a non-resident is required to pay an estimate of the tax before the sale, an amount equal to 25% of the gain. This amount is to be retained by the seller's lawyer until such time as a clearance certificate is received from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) in connection with the sale of the property. Upon payment, the CRA will issue a clearance certificate to the seller, but not until there has been a contract of purchase and sale with all subjects (conditions) removed. The wait for the certificate is usually 6-8 weeks. The non-resident seller should file a Canadian income tax return for the year in which the sale occurs and should expect to receive a refund of a portion of the taxes paid.<br><br>\r\n\r\n                Many countries, such as the U.S., have tax treaties with Canada that prevent you from being taxed in both Canada and your home country.

You are able to complete pre-registration forms before you cross the border which will make it easier and less time consuming.

If you have a PAL, you do not have to fill out registration forms and there is only a one time fee.<br><br>\r\n      You cannot import prohibited firearms. Fully automatic weapons, all hand guns and guns of less than 66 cm (26 inches) in length are prohibited by law.<br><br>\r\n      Restricted firearms such as pistols or revolvers may be temporarily imported if you have an Authorization to Transport (ATT) in advance from a Canadian Chief Firearms Officer.<br><br>\r\n      Seasonal residents may import restricted firearms, but must have a Possession and Acquisition License or a valid Firearms Acquisition Certificate in addition to an ATT.<br><br>\r\n      For more info on importing firearms into Canada: \r\n        Canadian Firearms Centre, 284 Wellington Centre.

Here are some tips to help make your crossing quick and easy:<br><br>\r\n      <b class=\"b\">Identification</b><br>\r\n      US Citizens and legal residents of the United States do not need passports or visas to enter Canada as visitors. You should however carry some identification such as birth, voter's or naturalization certificate which shows your citizenship.<br><br>\r\n      <b class=\"b\">Children</b><br>\r\n      Canada Customs and Immigration officers are members of Child Find International. Anyone travelling with children not their own may be required to show written permission from the child's parent(s) and proper identification (birth certificate).<br><br>\r\n      <b class=\"b\">Other Countries</b><br>\r\n      Visitors from countries other than the US require a valid passport and in some cases a visitor's visa. Visas are issued by Canadian Immigration offices, embassies and consulates.<br><br>\r\n      <b class=\"b\" >Making Declarations</b><br>\r\n      Canadian Customs officials will ask your place of residence (country and city) the purpose of your visit to Canada, how long you intend to stay, and if you have anything to declare. You may be asked specifically if you are bringing alcohol, tobacco, fruit, vegetables, animals or items made from animal by-products, firearms or personal protection devices into Canada.<br><br>\r\n      Gifts up to $60 (Canadian funds) each in value are duty free provided they do not contain alcohol, tobacco or advertising material.<br><br>\r\n      As long as you meet the age requirement set by the province where you enter Canada (19 in Ontario), you may import 1.5 litres of wine or 1.14 litres (40 ounces) of liquor OR 24 x 355 ml cans or bottles of beer or ale. Those over 18 years of age may bring 200 cigarettes, 50 cigars, 200 grams of manufactured tobacco and 200 tobacco sticks.<br><br>\r\n      <b class=\"b\">Pets</b><br>\r\n      Dogs and cats accompanying their owners from the U.S. must have current (within 36 months) rabies vaccination certificates. Owners from other countries who wish to bring their pets should contact the nearest Canadian consulate or embassy.<br><br>\r\n      <b class=\"b\">Boaters</b><br>\r\n      Pleasure craft may enter Canada by trailer or under their own power and stay for a period of up to 12 months. The required Entry Permit is obtainable from Customs at port-of-entry. All boats powered by motors 10 HP or over must be licensed and the license number clearly indicated on the bow of the vessel. Boat licenses from outside Ontario are acceptable.<br><br>\r\n      <b class=\"b\">Criminal Records</b><br>\r\n      Individuals with criminal records wishing to enter Canada can apply for a waiver. This should be done 3 - 4 weeks in advance of the intended visit. It should be noted that Driving Under the Influence convictions are considered a criminal offense in Canada. Individuals with criminal records without waivers can be refused entry. Contact the nearest port of entry Canada Immigration office for more information.<br><br>\r\n      <b class=\"b\">Your Dollar Goes Farther</b><br>\r\n      US dollars and several foreign currencies enjoy a premium rate of exchange in Canada.<br><br>\r\n      <b class=\"b\">Goods and Services Tax (GST)</b><br>\r\n      As a visitor to Canada you can claim a refund of 7% on every dollar spent while in the country on accommodation and most goods you take home.<br><br></p>\r\n              </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n          \r\n          <div class=\"card\">\r\n            <div class=\"card-header\" role=\"tab\" id=\"headingTwo\">\r\n              <h5 class=\"mb-0\">\r\n                <a class=\"collapsed\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#collapseTwentytwo\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapseTwentytwo\">\r\n                  <h5>10 - I have heard of something called a “CANPASS”, what is it?</h5>\r\n                </a>\r\n              </h5>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div id=\"collapseTwentytwo\" class=\"collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"headingTwentytwo\">\r\n              <div class=\"card-block\">\r\n                <p class=\"can\">If you frequently enter Canada from the U.S., you may qualify for one or more of our CANPASS programs designed to facilitate reporting to customs for pre-approved travellers.
